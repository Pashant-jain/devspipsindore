      St. Paul Institute of Professional Studies (SPIPS), Indore was established in the year 2010 with a vision of becoming a College with a difference. Even though the city of Indore boasted of a large number of Colleges offering Undergraduate courses, yet there was a demand from the society for establishing a Catholic/Christian College that would enrich the students with Value Based Quality Education.Within a short span of time, the College has earned a good reputation for itself by moulding the students into competent, committed and contributing citizens of the global family and by creating integrated personalities with discipline and quality.
